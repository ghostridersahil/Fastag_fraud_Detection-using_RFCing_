# Fastag Fraud Detection Project

![Fastag Fraud Detection]([https://your-image-url.com](https://resize.indiatvnews.com/en/centered/newbucket/1200_675/2020/01/fastag-scam-1579673546.jpg))

## Overview

This repository contains the code and resources for a Fastag fraud detection project. Fastag is an electronic toll collection system in India, and this project aims to detect fraudulent activities associated with Fastag usage.

## Features

- Data preprocessing: Includes data cleaning, feature engineering, and data transformation.
- Model development: Utilizes machine learning algorithms for fraud detection.
- Evaluation: Metrics for assessing the performance of the models.
- Deployment: Instructions for deploying the model in a production environment.

## Dataset
